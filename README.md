# MDP
Python script to find optimal policy from an MDP given in a json? format (Noise not considered yet)

race.json is a scenario based off of a racing car (just a testing template as I know the solution)

## Future Plan:

I will be deleting my GridWorld repo and turning it into a JSON to test it in here instead of doing it manually on another repo
